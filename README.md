# IoT-based-Water-level-Monitoring

Our project is an innovative solution for water level monitoring and control in tanks. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level, sending the data to a microcontroller for processing. The water level is continuously displayed on an LCD screen for easy monitoring.

One of the key features of our system is its alert mechanism. When the water level falls below a certain threshold, a buzzer is activated along with a red LED, and a notification is sent to the user's device to alert them of the low water level. The user can also turn on the pump directly from the mobile interface. If no action is taken, the pump automatically starts after 30 seconds.

Similarly, when the water level is too high, the system activates an alert with a buzzer and a red LED, and automatically turns off the pump to prevent overflow. A green LED indicates when the pump is operating, providing a visual indicator of the motor's status.
